      <description>Supply Chain Transformation for Affordable Food Access: In this ALX Month 2 project, I was the team lead. My team and I identified critical pain points within the agricultural supply chain, addressing challenges faced by both farmers and consumers. By creating a digital platform, I aimed to eliminate middlemen, reduce inefficiencies, and ensure fair pricing. The platform connects farmers directly with consumers, allowing for transparent transactions and reducing costs. With a focus on inclusivity, the solution caters to both technologically literate farmers and those without access to technology through strategic partnerships with community centers and agricultural cooperatives.</description>

      <description>The Bike Sharing Demand prediction project using AutoGluon is about building and training machine learning models to predict the demand for bike-sharing services. The project involves analyzing and preprocessing data from CSV files provided by the Kaggle competition. By leveraging the capabilities of AutoGluon&amp;rsquo;s Tabular Prediction, I engineered additional features, fine-tuned hyperparameters, and experimented with various models to achieve the most accurate predictions. The ultimate goal is to accurately forecast the demand for bike-sharing services, which can be valuable for companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to optimize their operations and provide better customer service.</description>

      <description>The Fake News Classifier is a supervised machine learning project built with Python to classify news articles as either real or fake. The primary goal of this project is to prototype a fake news detection system that can accurately identify and flag fake news articles. The model uses natural language processing techniques to extract features from the text of the articles and applies a classification algorithm to predict the class of each article.</description>

      <description>This project is an image classifier that can identify different breeds of dogs using deep learning techniques. The classifier is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained on a large dataset of dog images. The CNN is trained to recognize 133 different dog breeds, and can be used to predict the breed of a dog given an image of a dog. If the image is of a human, the CNN will identify the resembling dog breed or identify it as some other animal like a cat.</description>
